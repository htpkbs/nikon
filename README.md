# Overview

The nikon is a keyboard PCB.

It has:

* A mostly ortholinear layout
* Low profile Kailh Choc switches
* A split design
* Thumb key clusters
* USB-C
* Symmetry

# Scratch

Stuff that will go elsewhere but I want to make a note of for now.

Possibly use SK6812 MINI-E LEDs (same as Sofle Choc) (apparently "easy to solder").

# Key Layout

I'm trialing two key layouts.

No column stagger:

```
[{c:"#474747",t:"#cfcfcf",a:7},"`","1","2","3","4","5",{x:4.5},"6","7","8","9","0","PgUp"],
["Tab","Q","W","E","R","T",{h:1.5},"[",{x:2.5,h:1.5},"]","Y","U","I","O","P","PgDn"],
["Ctrl","A","S","D","F","G",{x:4.5},"H","J","K","L",";","'"],
[{y:-0.5,x:6,h:1.5},"-",{x:2.5,h:1.5},"="],
[{y:-0.5},"Shift","Z","X","C","V","B",{x:4.5},"N","M",",",".","/","Shift"],
["","","⌥",{w:1.5},"⌘",{x:7.5,w:1.5},"⌘","⌥","",""],
[{r:30,rx:7.5,ry:4,y:0.5,x:-0.75,w:1.5},""],
[{x:-2,h:1.5},"Del",{h:1.5},"Bksp",{h:1.5},"Fn"],
[{r:-30,rx:9,y:0.5,x:-0.75,w:1.5},"\\"],
[{x:-1,h:1.5},"Fn",{h:1.5},"",{h:1.5},"Return"]
```

With column stagger:

```
[{x:3,c:"#2e2e2e",t:"#9c9c9c",a:7},"3",{x:8.5},"8"],
[{y:-0.875,x:2},"2",{x:10.5},"9"],
[{y:-0.875,x:4},"4","5",{x:4.5},"6","7"],
[{y:-0.875},"`","1",{x:12.5},"0","PgUp"],
[{y:-0.375,x:3},"E",{x:8.5},"I"],
[{y:-0.875,x:2},"W",{x:10.5},"O"],
[{y:-0.875,x:4},"R","T",{h:1.5},"[",{x:2.5,h:1.5},"]","Y","U"],
[{y:-0.875},"Tab","Q",{x:12.5},"P","PgDn"],
[{y:-0.375,x:3},"D",{x:8.5},"K"],
[{y:-0.875,x:2},"S",{x:10.5},"L"],
[{y:-0.875,x:4},"F","G",{x:4.5},"H","J"],
[{y:-0.875},"Ctrl","A",{x:12.5},";","'"],
[{y:-0.625,x:6,h:1.5},"-",{x:2.5,h:1.5},"="],
[{y:-0.75,x:3},"C",{x:8.5},","],
[{y:-0.875,x:2},"X",{x:10.5},"."],
[{y:-0.875,x:4},"V","B",{x:4.5},"N","M"],
[{y:-0.875},"Shift","Z",{x:12.5},"/","Shift"],
[{y:-0.25,x:2},"⌥",{x:10.5},"⌥"],
[{y:-0.75},"","",{x:12.5},"",""],
[{r:15,rx:7.5,ry:4,y:1.25,x:-4.05,w:1.5},"⌘"],
[{r:30,y:-1.5,x:-0.625,w:1.5},"\\"],
[{x:-1.875,h:1.5},"Del",{h:1.5},"Bksp",{h:1.5},"Fn"],
[{r:-30,rx:9,y:0.75,x:-0.875,w:1.5},"\\"],
[{x:-1.125,h:1.5},"Fn",{h:1.5},"",{h:1.5},"Return"],
[{r:-15,y:-1.5,x:2.55,w:1.5},"⌘"]
